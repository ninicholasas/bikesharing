## Summary
Overall, the data shows that male subscribers are the pripary users of the bike-sharing program. The most popular time for the subscribers were on Thursday between 4pm to 8pm, and for the unsubscribed users the weekend were most popular.

Further on, I would recomend adding weather data to see if the usage of the bike-sharing program will differ or not and if so, by how much. Also I would recomend getting a seasonal data to see if the program is more active in certain months than others
